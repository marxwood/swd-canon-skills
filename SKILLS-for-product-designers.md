# Skills — For Product Designers Making the Shift to Entity-First

**Role:** Product designers trained in screen-first, flow-first, or component-first methods now working in systems where meaning needs to be the primary artifact.

## The shift in one sentence

You are no longer designing how things look. You are designing what things mean — and screens are one way that meaning gets rendered.

---

## Skill 1 — Naming entities before drawing anything

Before opening a design tool, ask: what is this interaction about? What entity? Name it precisely. This single habit prevents a category of design debt that accumulates when screens are designed without a shared vocabulary.

---

## Skill 2 — Designing states, not screens

Every entity has states. These are not screen variants — they are semantic conditions with different allowed actions and transitions. The skill is defining states as primary design artifacts. Before designing the Draft view, define what Draft means.

---

## Skill 3 — Designing edges, not menus

Navigation is relationship design — a map of how entities connect. The skill is asking: what is this connected to, and which connections are meaningful here?

---

## Skill 4 — Making constraints visible, not hiding them in UI patterns

A disabled button is a constraint. The skill is knowing what rule each visual pattern encodes — and making sure that rule is declared, not just implied. This is what makes the design governable and automatable.

---

## Skill 5 — Working with engineers as meaning collaborators

The conversation is not "here is the screen, build it." It is "here is the entity, its states, relationships, and capabilities — how do we render this?" Designers own meaning definition. Engineers own implementation. Both own validity.

---

## Skill 6 — Accepting that the product outlives the UI

If the design only exists as screens, every replatform starts from scratch. If the design exists as meaning definitions, every replatform is a re-rendering. Design with this in mind.
