# swd-canon-skills

A collection of transferable skills derived from [Semantic Web Design](https://github.com/marxwood/semantic-web-design) and the [System Momentum Canon](https://github.com/marxwood/system-momentum-canon).

## What this repository is

This repository contains scoped skills documents. Each document addresses a specific problem space, role, or use case — grounded in the same two sources: SWD (the design theory) and the Canon (its structural formalization).

These are not tutorials or frameworks. They are skill definitions: what you need to be able to do, why it matters, and where it comes from.

---

## What this repository is not

- A summary of SWD or the Canon
- A replacement for reading either source
- A governance manual or policy set
- A canonical artifact

All documents here are derivative artifacts. They reference their sources. They do not redefine them.
